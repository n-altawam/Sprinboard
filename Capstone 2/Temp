To compare your prediction model to the company's mean prediction model, you can perform a comparative analysis based on various evaluation metrics. Here's a step-by-step approach you can follow:

1. Gather data: Collect a dataset of short-term listings in NYC that includes the actual prices and relevant features used in your model.

2. Calculate predictions: Use your model to generate price predictions for the listings in the dataset.

3. Calculate mean predictions: Calculate the mean price of the listings in the dataset using the company's mean prediction model. This means taking the average of all the actual prices in the dataset.

4. Evaluate performance: Compare the performance of your model against the company's mean prediction model using evaluation metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), or Mean Percentage Error (MPE). Since you mentioned your model has an RMSE of 60.61, you can calculate the RMSE for the mean predictions as well.

5. Interpret the results: Compare the RMSE values of your model and the company's mean prediction model. If your model's RMSE is lower than the company's mean prediction model, it indicates that your model provides more accurate price estimates on average.

6. Visualize the comparison: Create visualizations such as scatter plots or line plots to compare the predicted prices from your model to the actual prices and the mean predictions from the company's model. This can help stakeholders visualize the differences in accuracy.

7. Explain the benefits: Present the findings and explain how your model outperforms the mean prediction model. Highlight the potential financial impact of using your model, such as improved revenue generation through optimized pricing strategies, better customer satisfaction through accurate pricing, and potential cost savings.

8. Provide additional insights: Showcase additional analysis or insights that your model provides, such as feature importance, outliers detection, or other patterns that can be useful for decision-making. This demonstrates the added value of your model compared to the simple mean prediction approach.

By following these steps and presenting your findings in a clear and compelling manner, you can demonstrate the usefulness of your prediction model to the company's shareholders and justify their investment in your project.
